# Resource <-> Agent

## definition

* range: Agent (its instance acts as object of a Statement)

## context

> from [Lynn's comment](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/63#issuecomment-148076481):

> Just so you picture it, this is how these things happen: They spend a lot of time community funding for a good 3d printer, finally get enough money, order and receive it, with great excitement. They realize, hey we don't want just anyone running the printer, it was really expensive. So they quickly throw in an agent - resource relationship, and define in their access rules for the resource that only someone who has that relationship can run the printer. Then they start experimenting with it, they spend a lot of time on that. They don't spend more than 15 seconds thinking about what they call the relationship.
